                                Patients lay on a table that gently pulls on the back to relieve pressure. This therapy offers
                                pain relief, especially when in the case of spinal disc issues such as bulging, degeneration, or herniation. Additionally
                                this therapy can treat lower back and sciatica nerve pain.

                                Flexion-Distraction: This therapy is a slow adjustment to the back, done on a table that applies a gentle wave like motion.
                                Flexion-Distraction therapy is also used to treat bulging, degenerating, or herniated spinal discs.

                                This therapy targets specific muscle groups with electrodes to either relax

                                More powerful than Ultrasound or Percussion therapy, Shockwave therapy uses a
                                small machine with a rubber ball to deliver a strong impact to the targeted muscle group massage deep into the tissue, relieving
                                deep muscle pain.

                                This therapy is similar to Ultrasound therapy, but reaches deeper into the muscles to ease tension. Overall
                                this therapy is like a deep tissue massage.

                <h1>About Dr.Cory</h1>
                <img src="images/cory.jpg" id="cory"/>
                <p>Cory grew up in a small town in PA where he decided he wanted to go to school to become a Chiropractor. He got his Bachelor of Sciene degree from Mansfield University in PA, then  started to attend the New York Chiropractic College in Seneca Falls, NY where he met and married his wife. After he graduated with his doctorate degree, Dr. Doubrava and his wife went to Rochester where he did his clinical rotations and also had their first child.</p>
                <p>After returning to the area, he recieved an assoctiateship at Vestal Chiropractic Center on the same day his second child was born. After 5 years (and two more children) Dr. Doubrava left his assoctiateship with Vestal Chiropractic Center although he loves the people and the atmosphere, he decided it was time to begin his own practice. Dr. Cory Doubrava and his wife Sarah decided to open Doubrava Family Chiropractic on Washington Ave. in Endicott. </p>
                <p>Dr. Doubrava has a very friendly and cheerful personality, his attitude always makes you feel welcomed and relaxed. He is committed to helping people by showing them the importance of proper health through nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and proper spinal alignment. He is known for providing thorough and effective chiropractic care for the entire family.</p>
                <p>Dr. Doubrava loves his family and spending time with them is the only thing he enjoys more than chiropractic. He is an avid outdoorsman and enjoys camping, hiking, fishing and campfires. Dr. Doubrava is very active and enjoys playing all sports. The only time he will ever sit still is when there is a NY Giants game on. </p>
                <p>More than anything else Dr. Doubrava is a very down to earth, kindhearted and efficient  diversified Chiropractor, who cares about his patients and cares about helping people.</p>
