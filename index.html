                <h1>Treatments</h1>
                <p>This is what we do specifically, conditions treated, and how we treat them. Would expanding and contracting
                boxes be a good fit here? How does Cory perform each of these? What tools does he use, and how?</p>
                <p>
                    Decompression Therapy: According to my research it's stretching out the spine. It's for pain relief,
                    especially when there's spinal disc issues such as bulging, degeneration, or herniation. Also good
                    for most lower back pains and sciatica nerve pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flexion-Distraction: Slow adjustment to back, also an option for bulging, degenerating, or herniated
                    discs. Same schtick as Decompression Therapy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Electro Stim Therapy: Shock the patient till they stop hurting basically. Useful in PT as well,
                    for contracting weak/poor functioning muscles. For pain, it should relax muscles, for PT it's most
                    likely going to contract muscles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultrasound: Use vibration to massage muscles. Ya can't hear it, since it's out of our hearing range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shockwave therapy: Like ultrasound but bigger and meatier. Instead of a bunch of little waves, it's
                    one big hit, possibly a few times per treatment. Kind of like just shooting someone with a reball.
                    Same function as ultrasound, just different method to achieve the same results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Percussion Therapy: the goldilocks therapy between ultrasound and shockwave therapy; is more intense
                    per hit than ultrasound, but less frequent waves. It's also not as intense as shockwave's hits, but
                    is more frequent. It's like a deep tissue massage from a masseuse. Great at easing out muscle tension,
                    like a massage. tl;dr a fancy name for a mechanized massage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heat therapy: warm things warm the affected area to treat pain. Great for arthritis, stiff muscles,
                    and deep skin tissue injuries
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cryotherapy: Typically a pain relief or inflammation reducer. Bring the affected area to near freezing
                    temps.

                <p>Let prospective patients know that specific pricing is made in person but also tell them the accepted forms
                of payment as well as which insurances are accepted.</p>
                <p>According to my research he can accept card payments from Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover,
                JCB, and UnionPay</p>

                <p>How to get there! Maybe look into Mapbox or Mapquest for an API we can use to display an interactive map with
                Cory's office</p>
                <p>We're going to use Google Maps because it has the best scalability (pay as you use it)</p>
